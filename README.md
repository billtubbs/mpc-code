# mpc-code
Various MATLAB scripts for implementing linear model predictive control (MPC).

The functions to calculate the prediction matrices are tested by comparing to the script [calcef.m](calcef.m) by Plamondon, Kettani and Desbiens ([source](https://corpus.ulaval.ca/jspui/bitstream/20.500.11794/19713/1/24892.pdf)).
